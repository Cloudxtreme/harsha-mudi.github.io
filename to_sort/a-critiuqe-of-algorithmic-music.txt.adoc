As of today, music is made either with hardware or software
or both.

All music has two parts - sound-engine + arrangement.

For electronic music, sound-engine is made of DSP algorithms.
That has pretty much been the case since 1970's.
For most music, it's people.
That has pretty much been the case since ages.

I have no idea why the algorave community thinks creating 
new DSP libraries ad-nauseum is new. Many machines and 
samples are freely available to fit the job.

When I first started looking at Algorithmic Composition,
I was very excited.

Can code produce music ?
Or put in another way, Can algorithms sequence music ?

The answer is no, mainly because it is a hard problem.
It's like asking can an Algorithm produce a sculpture or
write a book[1]. To trivialize it is just stupid.

Are algoravers doing anything in that direction ?
No. They typically use random numbers or some fancy genetic
algorithms, both of them give me an ear-ache.

Are algoravers simplyfing sequencing with algorithms ?
No. They are just interfacing with MIDI and think its
algorithms. In this case word algorithm, which implies
efficiency and what-not should not be used.

The initial algo-compositions I listened to showed promise,
I thought it was a question of maturity of the tooling.

After a couple more years, I slowly realized
it's not the tooling, it's actually the programmers.

Programmers are living in a big bubble.

Dirupting this, disrupting that. Just cheap products with 
instant mining and half-assed quality. If you have never attempted
making art, you don't have an idea what the word quality means[3].

Algoraving is a part of this bubble.

It's painful to watch the disrupting-everything-everywhere.com have 
an expired domain name and are nowhere year later.

Programming is not art,
Programmers are not artists,
Programmers are arrogant,
Creativity is just the first part of Art,
The other part is a motif,

Sadly if you are just a programmer you will not realize this,
because you have trained yourself to post in terms of up-votes,
in a community that is trained to make you think in terms of up-votes,
maintained by pedants who you don't want to meet AFK,
in a world of artifical mice,
optimized by SEO,
forgotten by tomorrow.

And now consider Algorthmic Musicians.
Just listen to some of the tunes, these people make.

What are they trying to convey ?

* Unemotional
* Dull
* Dry
* Probabilistic
* Going nowhere
* Monotonic
* Boring

tl;dr Nothing.

One of the curses of the modern world, thanks to post modernism
is demeaning of the word Art.

Any rubbish can be Art.


Andy Warhol and Van Gogh are equal in post modernism[1].

Even the post modernists should shudder to call this Music,
because alteast John Cage was being a bit DaDa.

Music is Abstract Emotion.
You can google for the list of Emotions.

It's new and experimental
  -- So what.
You didn't listen to all the songs.
  -- Show me an emotional song and the process how the emotion
     was implied,  I am happy to change my mind.
This is how the future is going to be
  -- I don't want to be a part of a dull random music scene
     with pedants as groupies.

And now listen to this,

Nostalgia.

Ofcourse a critique is useless without supplying a reasonable 
ablternative.

Title: "blah blah, ha ha, i did't read this, just your
opinion man."

Made with.
I call it hardcoded music.
It follows the glorious tradition of tracker music.

[1] Music is both like sculting than writing.
[1] As it should be obvious to the reader, I dislike
post modernism.
