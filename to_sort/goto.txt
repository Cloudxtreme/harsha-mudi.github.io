GOTO the ultimate programming language

Assembly is perfect.
In assembly code = data. In fact that is the basis of the turing machine.
It is convenient for Lisp programmers to omit history.

The defect rate in an x86 processor.
x86 is backwards compatible.

Perl6 x86 package manager.

1. GOTO is executed in fixed time

functions
tailcall

2. It is easier to write an inline function than a library function

3. Unrestricted GOTOS are useful for booting and exiting and art

4. GOTO directly maps to a state transitions

5. GOTO directly maps to branch/dispatch/control tables

6. GOTO reduces debugging time

7   Recursion always needs an additional state variable.
7.1 Recursion must push state information into runtime.

8. Parsers make use of tables and state machines

10. Turing machine is made up of GOTOS

11. How to imitate an unrestricted GOTO ?

1. Mutual Recursion
2. Nested Exceptions
3. Infinite loops
4. Fake a von
5. Sequence closures
5.1 Command chain
