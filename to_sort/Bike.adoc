Move your spine !
Plan it.
Use two-three fingers for clutch.
Clutch is 1/2 gear
Feather touch

You ride on clutch alone
Clutch like accelerator, should move in the same direction always
Ditto for brake
At low speeds lean in the oppostie end, due to balancing issues
Lean your knee
Adjust choke when the boke is not starting

Countersteering:
1. steer a little right. push left.
2. push the handle in that direction
