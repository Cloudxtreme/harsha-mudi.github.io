Thus no core dumps should ever be necessary. It was\nlogically impossible for any source language program to cause the\ncomputer to run wild, either at compile time or at run time. A\nconsequence of this principle is that every occurrence of every\nsubscript of every subscripted variable was on every occasion checked\nat run time against both the upper and the lower declared bounds\nof the array. Many years later we asked our customers whether they\nwished us to provide an option to switch off these checks in the\ninterests of efficiency on production runs.

Thus no core dumps should ever be necessary. It was\nlogically impossible for any source language program to cause the\ncomputer to run wild, either at compile time or at run time. A\nconsequence of this principle is that every occurrence of every\nsubscript of every subscripted variable was on every occasion checked\nat run time against both the upper and the lower declared bounds\nof the array.

Systems","author":"Sreeharsha Mudivarti","tags":["programming","future"],"copyright":"CC BY-NC","__content":"\n\nComputing is still primitive and Fragile.\n\nFor example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography\">Typography</a> is an ancient profession.\nCSS3 is just cute, compared to what Typographers can do.\n\nIt is haughty to think that computers can do everything, with fidelity.\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_knuth\">Donald Knuth</a> spent a disproportionate amount of time on typesetting,\nand rightfully so.\n\nTo put Entity Systems in context, here is a list of programming\nparadigms as used in the Software Industry.\n\nAutomata Programming\n====================\n\nAutomata/ State Machines are at the heart of all Software.\n\n* Parsers\n* Validation Mechanisms\n* Protocols\n* Circuit Design\n* Industrial Robots\n\nCurrently state machines can be implemented by the following\ntechniques,\n\n1. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern\">State Pattern</a>\n\n   This is the OO way of doing it.\n\n2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatch_table\">Dispatch Tables</a>\n\n   This uses function pointers.\n\n3. Goto's\n\n   I find it appalling that gotos are considered a <a href=\"http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/2/29/the-joke-is-on-us-how-ruby-1-9-supports-the-goto-statement\">joke</a>.\n\n   Here is a Knuth's defence of <a href=\"http://cs.sjsu.edu/~mak/CS185C/KnuthStructuredProgrammingGoTo.pdf\">goto</a>. The paper also has a hint of satire,\n   on how programming language designers are complicit in advocating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak\">Newspeak</a>,\n   for \"safety\".\n\n   Just for a perspective, see the <a href=\"http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/9/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c?view=markup#l631\">tcp/ipv4</a> code from FreeBSD.\n\n   This code is used by <a href=\"http://www.scei.co.jp/ps4-license/\">Sony</a> and many embedded systems.\n   The Linux implementation is <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp.c\">similiar</a>.\n\n<blockquote>The most critical piece of Internet Infrastructure is designed\nas a state machine using goto's.</blockquote>\n\n   Using goto's is hardly different from Dispatch Tables.\n   RAM is a hardware implementation of a table.\n\n   Why is there, no joke on this <a href=\"http://lua-users.org/wiki/GotoStatement\">page</a> ?\n   Probably because it's used in the Electronics Industry.\n\n   Blaming goto's is like blaming a Scalpel.\n\n\nStructured Programming\n======================\n\nThis has the following styles,\n\n1. Procedural Programming\n\n   See <a href=\"http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/wirth-refinement.html\">Program Development by Stepwise Refinement</a>\n   Typically how you write C programs.\n\n2. Objective Programming\n\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming)\">Encapsulation</a> for me, is the most important idea here.\n\n3. Modular Programming\n\n   <code>\n   &gt;&gt;&gt; import this\n   ...\n   Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n   </code>\n\n4. Functional Programming\n\n   Functional programming structures code around transformations,\n   than state changes.\n\n   It's tricky to do <a href=\"http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html\">Games</a> in Pure Functional Programming.\n   Impure Functional Programming as seen in Common Lisp, Clojure,\n   Perl, Python, Ruby, OCaml is more successful.\n\nDeclarative Programming\n=======================\n\nThe following are some fine examples,\n\n1. HTML, make\n2. SQL, Logic Programming\n3. DSL's and Scripting Components.\n\n   See <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html\">Rake</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_70_release\">Blender API</a>\n\n4. Generative Programming\n\n   This includes Lispy Macros, <a href=\"http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/\">yacc</a>.\n\nEvent Driven Programming\n========================\n\nComputers react to events.\n\n1. Messaging\n\n   <a href=\"http://zeromq.org/\">Zero MQ</a>\n\n2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_Pattern\">Observers</a>\n3. Callback (Hell)\n4. Services\n\n   See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST\">REST</a>\n\nData Flow Programming\n=====================\n\nThis is my favorite paradigm.\nImpure Functional programming fits nicely here.\n\n1. Unix <a href=\"http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/pipes/\">Pipes</a>\n\n   Nuff said.\n\n2. Max/Pure Data\n\n   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y_Tzelw91g\">You just have to see it</a>.\n\n3.

Goto's\n\n   I find it appalling that gotos are considered a <a href=\"http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/2/29/the-joke-is-on-us-how-ruby-1-9-supports-the-goto-statement\">joke</a>.\n\n   Here is a Knuth's defence of <a href=\"http://cs.sjsu.edu/~mak/CS185C/KnuthStructuredProgrammingGoTo.pdf\">goto</a>. The paper also has a hint of satire,\n   on how programming language designers are complicit in advocating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak\">Newspeak</a>,\n   for \"safety\".\n\n   Just for a perspective, see the <a href=\"http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/9/sys/netinet/tcp_input.c?view=markup#l631\">tcp/ipv4</a> code from FreeBSD.\n\n   This code is used by <a href=\"http://www.scei.co.jp/ps4-license/\">Sony</a> and many embedded systems.\n   The Linux implementation is <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/tcp.c\">similiar</a>.\n\n<blockquote>The most critical piece of Internet Infrastructure is designed\nas a state machine using goto's.</blockquote>\n\n   Using goto's is hardly different from Dispatch Tables.\n   RAM is a hardware implementation of a table.\n\n   Why is there, no joke on this <a href=\"http://lua-users.org/wiki/GotoStatement\">page</a> ?\n   Probably because it's used in the Electronics Industry.\n\n   Blaming goto's is like blaming a Scalpel.\n\n\nStructured Programming\n======================\n\nThis has the following styles,\n\n1. Procedural Programming\n\n   See <a href=\"http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/wirth-refinement.html\">Program Development by Stepwise Refinement</a>\n   Typically how you write C programs.\n\n2. Objective Programming\n\n   <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(object-oriented_programming)\">Encapsulation</a> for me, is the most important idea here.\n\n3. Modular Programming\n\n   <code>\n   &gt;&gt;&gt; import this\n   ...\n   Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n   </code>\n\n4. Functional Programming\n\n   Functional programming structures code around transformations,\n   than state changes.\n\n   It's tricky to do <a href=\"http://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html\">Games</a> in Pure Functional Programming.\n   Impure Functional Programming as seen in Common Lisp, Clojure,\n   Perl, Python, Ruby, OCaml is more successful.\n\nDeclarative Programming\n=======================\n\nThe following are some fine examples,\n\n1. HTML, make\n2. SQL, Logic Programming\n3. DSL's and Scripting Components.\n\n   See <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html\">Rake</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_70_release\">Blender API</a>\n\n4. Generative Programming\n\n   This includes Lispy Macros, <a href=\"http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/\">yacc</a>.\n\nEvent Driven Programming\n========================\n\nComputers react to events.\n\n1. Messaging\n\n   <a href=\"http://zeromq.org/\">Zero MQ</a>\n\n2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_Pattern\">Observers</a>\n3. Callback (Hell)\n4. Services\n\n   See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST\">REST</a>\n\nData Flow Programming\n=====================\n\nThis is my favorite paradigm.\nImpure Functional programming fits nicely here.\n\n1. Unix <a href=\"http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/pipes/\">Pipes</a>\n\n   Nuff said.\n\n2. Max/Pure Data\n\n   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y_Tzelw91g\">You just have to see it</a>.\n\n3. Spreadsheets\n\n   Most widely used Programming Language if you ask me.\n\n4. Visual Programming\n\n   A bit of a stretch, but anything from Photoshop layers to Circuit Design goes here.\n\nParallel Programming\n====================\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)\">Erlang</a> is a great success story.\n\nEntity Systems\n==============\n\nIn a way <a href=\"http://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/entity-component-game-programming-using-jruby-and-libgdx-part-1/\">Entity Systems</a>, takes concepts from every one of the above.\nI am not even sure it's a new Paradigm.\n\nBut the reason I am excited about Entity Systems is, it puts us right back\ninto <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing\">Batch Computing</a>.
