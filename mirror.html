<h2>Mirror Ontology</h2>
<div class="lineno"></div>

<article class="post">The principles shall now be explained,
Earth, water, fire and air are the principles.
By whom came this variety ? from their own nature was it born !

Perception is the only valid source of knowledge.
The body is the source of consciousness; not an imperceptible soul.
As no other world entities are seen, there is no other world.

While life is yours, live joyously !
Even freed from fear,
None can escape Death's searching eye.

-- An Epicurean

Atom
Star
Nature
DNA
Microbes
Plants
Animal
Man
Words
World

Hormones
========

Growth (upperbound)
Sex (periodic)
Sleep (periodic)
Immunity (linear)

Mind
====

1. Filters and Buffers aka Input (Perception)
2. Short Messages(Neurotransmitters) / Timed Messages (Hormones)
3. Control Systems(Reflection)
4. Short / Working / Long terms Memory
5. Action

Delay
=====

0. Void
1. Light
2. Sound
3. Heat
5. Electricity
6. Imbalance
7. Speech
9. Data
10. Genes
11. Mass
12. Recollection

Process times
=============

Thought (recursive)
Demand Supply (variadic)
Replication (linear)
Learning (polynomial)
Knowledge Accumulation (exponential)
Puzzle (infinite)
Satisfaction (NAN)

Self
====

It constantly matches the structure of reality with memory.

1. Observed ?

No.
Throw everything out.

2. Modified ?

Yes.

Modified
- Modification of memory.
- Modification of bootcode.

Both can happen internally or externally or external-to-internal.
Reality is that which is remembered.

3. Stopped ?

No.

Herein lies both the possibility for AI and impossibility of self-knowledge.

Focus
=====

At a time, focus can only be on one.
If focus is more than on two, then there is a cascade.

Freedom
=======

The free man is a warrior.

The highest type of free men should be sought where the highest
resistance is constantly overcome: five steps from tyranny, close
to the threshold of the danger of servitude.

Danger alone acquaints us with our own resources, our virtues, our
armor and weapons, our spirit, and forces us to be strong. First
principle: one must need to be strong — otherwise one will never
become strong.

Radical Constructivism
======================

Measurement creates Knowledge about Reality.
Reality can never be experienced by Knowledge.

There is no private knowledge.
Knowledge transforms culture just like how an industry transforms raw materials to air.
Knowledge is not passively received but actively created.
Knowledge expands like a straight line.

By simple dialectic Knowledge can be used for both creation and destruction.

Knowledges compete in Language games.
Knowledge useful for the survival of a subject / organization, survives.

A Suject is as the same as the Knowledge feelings, thoughts, identities accumulated.
Death of the Subject is death of some Knowledge.

Knowledge is re-inforced cruelly by means of imitation resulting in Dogma.

Subjects have the full freedom to create an experimental Knowledge and stand alone.

Therapy is forgetting.
The same for this.</article>
