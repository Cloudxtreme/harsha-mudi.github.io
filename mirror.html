<h2>Mirror Ontology</h2>
<div class="lineno"></div>

<article class="post">The principles shall now be explained,
Earth, water, fire and air are the principles.
By whom came this variety ? from their own nature was it born !

Perception is the only valid source of knowledge.
The body is the source of consciousness; not an imperceptible soul.
As no other world entities are seen, there is no other world.

While life is yours, live joyously !
Even freed from fear,
None can escape Death's searching eye.

-- C-c C-v

1. The world is made of self-similar structures.

    Atom
    Star

    DNA
    Nature

    Microbes
    Plants

    Animal
    Man

    Words
    World

    Each is built on top of the other. It is difficult to pin-point where
    an atom ends and a star begins.

2. The human body is completely automatic.

   There is no "free will" in

    Growth
    Sex
    Sleep
    Disease

3.

<img src="images/mind.svg"/>

   Various delays and feedback loops come into the picture.

   Additional delays of the following are also applicable
        light
        sound
        heat
        motor control
        speech
        sense processing
        recollection

   Not only delays, memory can decay.

4. The "I" that an individual perceives is a feedback delay.

5. The mind is a mirror, an imperfect one of REALITY.

6. What "is" can be divided into

   REALITY, of which nothing can be said except this.
   reality which is the individual memory.
   Social Reality, the least common denominator of realities.
   Reality which is the social reality as perceived by the individual.

   What this implies in raw numbers is that, the total number of
   realities at any given moment is (Individuals x Societies x 2) + 1.

   The number is obviously merely for demonstration purposes.
   "Mad" people have been know to experience more than one reality at once.

7. "Free will" is ability of an individual to shape his reality by selective
   enforcement of memory.

   As reality is a part of REALITY, an individual will have an indirect affect
   or none at all on REALITY.

   The butterfly may or may not cause the fucking typhoon.

8. As realities are nothing but memory, all revolutions and revelations are just
   memory experiences cruelly enforced.

  For example, if `0 - 2 = 0 and 0 + 2 = 0` is valid for a number system.
  Teachers won't be apologetic for the children they beat.
  New teachers will certainly beat the children who give a wrong answer now.

  If the earth started having regular "mini" earthquakes, no one would
  be able to demonstrate "Simple Harmonic Motion".

  Seen this way, there is no private memory which is a much harsher restatement of
  Wittgenstein's "there is no private language".

9. Mind is a mere minder of senses with memory with a previous version of I.

    As in,

    "What did I do back then ?"
    "Aha"
    "Let me do it now with with these new inputs"
    ...

    New outputs are stored in memory, with the current I and acted upon.
    In other words, there is an eternal self-reflexivity for the self.

    In crude terms "I" is nothing but a key-generator and memory is the bucket.

10. Although it was said in 9 that Mind is a mere minder, no minder algorithm
    can be deduced by any amounts of investigation.

    A mirror can never look at itself by using another mirror.

    All that can be said of the mirror by the mirror, if the mirror had any sentience
    is -- "I seem to exist. I can mirror".

11. If 10 were indeed the case, then AI is simply not possible on a human level.

12. Intelligent Robots will have a level of self-conscience a human can never have.

    This means that robots will simply not pollute nature.
    If one robot discovers that polluting is "bad", then all robots upgrade to do "good"
    and plant more trees.

    Such a robot is more beautiful than a petulant human who even after 100_000
    religions, movies, songs ... changed radically.

    Maybe self-aware robots are humanities gift to Nature ?

13. All delusions, anxieties, obsessions, phobias, hate, love are multiplicative
    feedback loops unto the Mind.

   If a microphone is not insulated from the speakers, a musician will not be able
   to play his guitar.

   Thus therapy is avoiding too much "feedback loops".

14. Memory as a drug is sold in the marketplace as "Becoming".
    There is no "Becoming".

    If two computers swap hard disks,
    Have the operating miseries changed ?

tl;dr
All memory is dogma.
"I" is a hash-key.
The same for this.
