Open Source Programming is heavily dependent on communication
channels.

IRC, Mailing Lists, Conferences, Web ...

Because of its global nature, it's very difficult to obey
all legal laws.

There are some controversies w.r.t the names and abbreviations
used in <a href="https://gist.github.com/omega8cc/fa97ea1d471e1108ab35">public code.</a>

Besides, Newspeak is a terrible (programming) language.

Each community is coming up with its own S.O.C's but they are too
narrow or too obvious.

To avoid unnecessary flamings, here are some guidelines for
Safe Free Speech, for the Individual.

0. There are no rules.
1. If you can use clean language, prefer it.
   If you have to be dirty, add a bit of context.
2. If you have to discuss grey-areas, prefer using existing
   legal protections.
3. Avoid Discrimination. Exceptions can always be found.
4. Hug before you hate.
