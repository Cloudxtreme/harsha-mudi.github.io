Internet is a m-n Communication model, with some twists.

* m = 1 for private messaging
* bad quality content for large m and large n
* poor dpi, resolution, bitrates
* content agnostic -- text, images, video, sound
* cost for consumption increases as m increases
* cost for creation increases as n increases

* when m is small and n is large, it resembles TV with all its faults
** grosser kistch is the dominant aesthetic
** unregulated medium

* like Pirate Radio, m and n can be small
** this is the most unique possibility with the internet

* archival value for public domain
* interactive yellow pages

For consumers,

* use it like a tv, news
* find niche communities

For creators,
* treat it like a tv
* make news
* treat it like an archive
* get listed in yellow pages
* find niche communities
