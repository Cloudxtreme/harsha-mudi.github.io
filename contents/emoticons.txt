<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons">Emoticons</a> fascinate me.

They are the resurgence of pictographs, a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs">Egyptian Hieroglyphs</a>,
or the Chinese symbols.

For example, ⼮ is the Chinese symbol for river.

Here are some new interesting emoticons, that I found in the wild wild web,

ಠ_ಠ      -- disapproval (that's the Kannada <a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/0CA0/">http://unicode-table.com/en/0CA0</a>)
ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ   -- happy
ᕙ(‸‶)ᕗ    -- lack of muscles
<<°°>>     -- crab
:{C       -- a sad English gentleman
:C        -- hipster sad face
∎-∎       -- cooling glasses
(-_-)凸   -- showing the finger

Exploring multi-language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">unicode</a>, alphabets and coming up with your own,
is silly, stupid and you should totally try doodling some.

Here are some that I discovered,

ఠ_ఠ      -- worried about your sanity
౪       -- stethoscope
(‸‶       -- amazed that you can actually do that
(‸‶)౨   -- why do you always
--ల     -- punch (looks like a boxing glove)

The above use some alphabets of Telugu,
<a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/search/?q=telugu">http://unicode-table.com/en/search/?q=telugu</a>.

(The above is best viewed in browsers with good alphabet coverage,
 like chrome, otherwise you will see empty boxes)
