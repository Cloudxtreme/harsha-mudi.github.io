Kant calls for the public use of private reason, and the private
use of public reason.

It's an excellent defense of free speech, as it guides 
one to put private speech in public, rawly, for public feedback.

It encourages one to take public feedback into private thinking,
to make one's reasoning purer.

You can read Kant's essay, "What is Enlightenment ?", <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html">here</a>.

This blog represents the private thoughts and reasons 
of the author for the public git.
