As usual Guitars solos fascinated me.
I did the air guitar, I couldn't afford an electic guitar.
                                                                                                                                                     could not afford an elcectric guitar. could not afford one, so it remeained a dream.
In 2011, I started listening to electronic music on a regular basis.

I tried out fruity loops, ableton [Pirated].

The first thing that that i experienced was dissillusionment,
Too many buttons,
Colors,
and terms like MIDI, track, sequencer, piano roll, OSC, Sampler, Soundfont, Synthesizer, Effect, Mixer, track, LFO,
VST, rewire, automation, filter, equalizer, DSP, FM, AM, AS, SS, PM, arpeggiator, patch.

Pure Data was a bit minimal and free, so I learnt a lot from it.

I would say my Influences are,
Pink Floyd
Skream,
Radio Head,
Nirvana,
The Clash,
Hans Zimmer.

I like all genres. I usually look for Independence and Skill in the artist.

I understand the musical notation now I guess.
I understand music meter as poetry and counting.

In case you are a beginner, just remember ...
Music is arrangement.
