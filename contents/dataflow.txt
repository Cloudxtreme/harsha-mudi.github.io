# Two types of Data

1. Continuous
2. Discrete

Continuous data needs bounded buffers to avoid overflow.
All systems are discrete unless mentioned otherwise.

# Types of Connection

## Pure Data (Continuous + Discrete)

### "Live" Object
m inlets + j control-inlets
&lt;process&gt;
n control outlets + k control-outlets

## Javelin

### Cell
1 controller
&lt;identity&gt;
n sinks

### Formula
n sources
&lt;script&gt;
1 sink

## Pipes
1 input
&lt;process&gt;
2 outputs

## Subroutines
1 tuple
&lt;routine&gt;
1 tuple

## Message Passing
1 publisher
&lt;notify&gt;
n subscribers

# Structure of Nodes

1. Static
2. Dynamic
3. Re-Configurable

Re-Configurable Flows are called Workflows.

# Concurrency

Concurrent Data Flows require a context matching algorithm.

# Flow Direction

1. Duplex (Subroutines)
2. Pipeline or Push
3. Pull

# Environment

1. Asnc
2. Clock
3. Hybrid
