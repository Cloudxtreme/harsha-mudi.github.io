In English, capitalization applies to,

1) First word
2) Proper noun

Some new rules,

When a Proper Noun has more than one word, use capitalization
for both the words, just like CamelCase

When a verb has more than one word, captalize the second word.

When describing attribtutes, use hyphenation.

When a Verb is used as a noun, capitalize it.

When you feel like, emphasizing a word, capitalize it.

When the word really needs to stand out, CAPITALIZE EVERYTHING.
