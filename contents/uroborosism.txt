Myths
=====

I was sitting, writing at my text-book; but the work did not progress;
my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed.
Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller
groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered
more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish
larger structures of manifold conformation: long rows, sometimes
more closely fitted together; all twining and twisting in snake-like
motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold
of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As
if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the
rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis.

Quotes
======

I don't like ass kissers, flag wavers or team players.
I like people who buck the system. Individualists.
I often warn people: "Somewhere along the way, someone is going to tell you,
'There is no "I" in team.' What you should tell them is,
'Maybe not. But there is an "I" in independence, individuality and integrity.'"

-- George  Carlin
