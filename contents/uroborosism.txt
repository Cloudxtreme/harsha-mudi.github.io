Behold The Serpent
==================

Behold him in his glorious joy:
Obsidian coils glist’ning against
The darkness of the Void
Where he frolics.
His mighty sinewy trunk
Weaves being
On the loom
Of time.

Behold him in his cunning
When he draws his black body erect,
His lush velvet shadow
Languidly caressing your spine.
His eyes like dark and distant flames
Scorch what he sees
With a cold fire.
 
Behold him in his golden splendour
When he has shed his old skin
And become wise.
When he towers over you now
The fire in his eyes
Illuminates what is
With wry, loving
Amusement.

Quotes
======

I was sitting, writing at my text-book; but the work did not progress;
my thoughts were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire and dozed.
Again the atoms were gamboling before my eyes. This time the smaller
groups kept modestly in the background. My mental eye, rendered
more acute by the repeated visions of the kind, could now distinguish
larger structures of manifold conformation: long rows, sometimes
more closely fitted together; all twining and twisting in snake-like
motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold
of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As
if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the
rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis.

-- August Kekulé
   (discovered benzene)

I don't like ass kissers, flag wavers or team players.
I like people who buck the system. Individualists.
I often warn people: "Somewhere along the way, someone is going to tell you,
'There is no "I" in team.' What you should tell them is,
'Maybe not. But there is an "I" in independence, individuality and integrity.'"

-- George  Carlin
