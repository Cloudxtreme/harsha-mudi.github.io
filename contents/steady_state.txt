Nature (beyond senses)

World (value-binding)
Plants (energy binding)
Animals (space binding)
Microbes (space-energy binding)

Memory (time binding)
Thought (space-time binding)
Will (energy-time binding)

Steady State
============

Steady state means leaving Nature alone.

World + Action - Energy = World

Action - Energy = Work ~~ 0

Action = Senses + Memory + Will + Thought + Communication

Memory is a sponge.
It is easy to corrupt memory by non-sense.
