Programming is an activity of designing Software Applications and Interactive Media.
A Software Application is a Control System with Digital Interfaces suited for the particular Domain.
Data, Components and Flows constitute the Constrol System of the Software .

Data
====
- ER / Binary / XML / Object
- Queries
- Serialization
- Storage and Caching
- Indexing / Searching / Tagging
- Compression
- Ontology
- Analytics
- Objects
- Triggers
- Validation
- Transforms
- Commands
- Queries
- Extractors
- Loaders

Components
==========

Function is a passive Component.
Co-Routine / CPS / Active Objects / Processes are Active Components.

1. A life cycle
2. A way to get inputs and interrupts
2. An execution body
3. A way to delegate outputs
4. State

Execution body is made of
- System Calls and Instructions
- Decisions and Loops
- Arithmetic
- Passive Components

A set of Related Components is a Module.

Active Components can be,
    Reactive
    Stream
    Simple
    Controller
    Main Controller
    Scheduler
    Router
    Filters
    Firewall

Active Components are built out of Objects.

User Interfaces
===============
- Forms
- Widgets
- Layouts
- Scene Graph
- Roles and Actions

Flows
=====

Couplings are built out of Objects as well.
Data flows across a coupling.

Module Coupling
- Reflection

Passive Component Coupling
- Function Calls
- Interceptors
- Function Pointers
- Continuations / Promises

Active Component Coupling
- Messaging
- FBP

User Interface Coupling
- Observers

Remote
- RPC
- FBP
- Half Objects

Mix
- Request / Response
- Tokens
- Message Queues

Programming
===========

0. Gather User Stories
1. Code the User Interfaces concretely or abstractly
2. Design Data
3. Couple User Interfaces to Components
4. Couple Components
5. Simulate / Demo
6. Repeat

Characteristics of Software
===========================
- Size
- Speed
- Bandwidth
- Memory

Deployment
==========
- Build
- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- Upgrading

Testing Software
=================
- End User Simulation
- Stress Testing
- Edge Case Testing
- Security Testing
- Component Testing

Naming Conventions
==================
Data / Events Should follow structural Naming Conventions.
Operations are AdjectiveNouns
Callbacks are VerbNouns

Files should be organized by
- Data Models
- Components
- Passive Components
- Main Component
- User Interfaces
- Couplings
- Simulations
