Or what they don't teach you in School.

What is a Program ?
===================
- Code + Data

Code
====
Operation
- Selection, Grouping, Loading
- Sequencing, Coupling, Distributing, Communicating, Controlling
- Iteration, Scheduling
- Self Verification

over a Stream of Data.

Verification happens by
- Assertions / Invariants
- Logs
- Exceptions
- Debugging

Data
====
- ER / Binary / XML / Object
- Queries
- Serialization
- Storage and Caching
- Validation
- Indexing / Searching / Tagging
- Compression
- Ontology
- Analytics
- Events

Interfaces
==========
- Forms
- Widgets
- Layouts
- Scene Graph
- Routers / Controllers

Operation
=========
- Functions
- System Calls
- Component Methods

Selection
========
- Table
- If
- Loader

- Namespaces and Symbols
- Module / Class / Library
- Dependency Injection
- Locator
- Polymorphism

Sequencing
==========
- Function Calls
- Composition
- Delegation
- RPC

- Pub / Sub / Subject / Observers / Message Bus
- Interceptors
- Data Flow

- Message Queues
- RPC

- Control Bus
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Co-routines
- Half Objects

Iteration
=========
- Startup
- Recursion
- Loops
- Processes / Threads / Contexts
- Tokens

Code Design
===========
1. Code the Interface
2. Couple Interface to Operations
3. Couple Operations to Operations
4. Couple Operations to Interfaces

Operation Characteristics
=========================
- Size
- Speed
- Bandwidth
- Memory

Deployment
==========
- Build
- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- Simulations / Tests

Naming Conventions
==================
Data / Events Should follow structural Naming Conventions.
Operations are AdjectiveNouns
Callbacks are VerbNouns

Operation Types
===============
Application
Remote Calls
Authentication
Authorization
Transforms
Extensions
Commands
Queries
Jobs
Operations
Routines
Extractors
Loaders
Routers / Controllers
Workflow
Generic
