Programming is an activity of designing Software Applications and Interactive Media.

A Software Application is a Control System with Digital Interfaces suited
for the particular Domain.

Work flows and User Interfaces around Data are the main Ingredients of Software.

Work flows constitute backend.
User Interfaces constitute the frontend.

Both require distinct mindsets.

Data
====
- ER / Binary / XML / Object
- Queries
- Serialization
- Storage and Caching
- Validation
- Indexing / Searching / Tagging
- Compression
- Ontology
- Analytics
- Events

Work
====

Basic Work
- If
- Loops
- Recursion
- System Calls
- Arithmetic
- Routines / Co-Routines
- Jobs
- Processes

Self-Work
- Loaders / Locators for Libraries

Context Management
- State Machines
- Push Down Automata
- Schedulers
- Controllers
- Routers

Self-Verification
- Assertions / Invariants
- Logs
- Exceptions
- Debugging

Security
- Authentication
- Authorization

Data Work
- Transforms
- Commands
- Queries
- Extractors
- Loaders

Flows
=====

Coupling in the form of

- Function Calls
- Table Based Dispatch / Ploymorphism
- Composition
- Delegation
- RPC
- Interceptors
- Pub / Sub / Subject / Observers / Messaging / Eventing
- Commands
- FBP
- Message Queues
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Half Objects
- Request / Response
- Tokens

Interfaces
==========
- Forms
- Widgets
- Layouts
- Scene Graph
- Interfaces
- Roles

Programming
===========

0. Gather User Stories
1. Code the Abstract Interface
2. Couple Interface to Workflows and Data Flows
3. Simulate / Demo
4. Repeat

Characteristics of Software
===========================
- Size
- Speed
- Bandwidth
- Memory

Deployment
==========
- Build
- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- Simulations / Tests

Naming Conventions
==================
Data / Events Should follow structural Naming Conventions.
Operations are AdjectiveNouns
Callbacks are VerbNouns

Files should be organized by
- Modules / Classes
- Models
- Loaders / Locaters
- Workflow Components
- Coupling Components
- Interfaces
