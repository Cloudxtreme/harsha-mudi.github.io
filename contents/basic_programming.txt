Programming is an activity of designing Software Applications and Interactive Media.

A Software Application is a Control System with Digital Interfaces suited for the particular Domain.
Data, Components and Flows constitute the Constrol System of the Software .

Data
====
- ER / Binary / XML / Object
- Queries
- Serialization
- Storage and Caching
- Indexing / Searching / Tagging
- Compression
- Ontology
- Analytics
- Commands
- Queries
- Extractors
- Loaders
- Parsing
- Events / Tokens / Symbols
- Sessions
- Snapshots

Components
==========

An Active Component has a

1. A life cycle
2. A way to get inputs and interrupts
2. An execution body
3. A way to delegate outputs
4. A way to maintain State across successive calls
5. A way to trigger events

Execution body is made of
- System Calls and Instructions
- Decisions and Loops
- Arithmetic
- Passive Components

A Passive Component is just made of execution body.

A set of Related Components is a Module.
Module manages dependencies as well.

Active Components can be,
    Reactive
    Stream
    Simple
    Controller
    Scheduler
    Router
    Filters
    Validators
    Transformers
    Authentication
    Authorization

User Interfaces
===============
- Forms
- Widgets
- Layouts
- Scene
- Graph
- Actions

Flows
=====

Flows are Data Driven on Demand Driven.
Flow occurs between component couplings.
Data flows across a coupling.

How to build components and flows ?
===================================

Function is a Passive Component.

Activte components can be built with the following,
1. State Objects
2. Closures / Command Objects
3. Objects
4. Co-Routines
5. Threads / Processes
6. Active Objects
7. Recursive Functions

Modules have an implicit coupling to names.
Reflection alievates this.

Passive Component Coupling
- Function Calls
- Function Pointers
- Continuations
- Promises

Active Component Coupling
- Messaging (Bus)
- FBP (Wire)
- Interceptors (Call)

User Interface Coupling
- Observers

Remote
- RPC
- Half Objects
- Request / Response

Programming
===========

0. Gather User Stories
1. Code the User Interfaces concretely or abstractly
2. Design Data
3. Couple User Interfaces to Components
4. Couple Components
5. Simulate / Demo
6. Repeat

An Application has atleast one active component.
A Scene should have atleast one active component and Observers.
An Interactive Application has a Message Bus.

An application with more than one component should have a Module.

Characteristics of Software
===========================
- Size
- Speed
- Bandwidth
- Memory

Deployment
==========
- Build
- Version Control
- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- Upgrading

Testing Software
=================
- End User Simulation
- Stress Testing
- Edge Case Testing
- Security Testing
- Component Testing
- Component Internals Testing
- Tracing
- Logging

Naming Conventions
==================
Data / Events Should follow structural Naming Conventions.
Operations are AdjectiveNouns
Callbacks are VerbNouns

Files should be organized by
- Base
- Data Models
- Components
- Passive Components
- Main Component
- User Interfaces
- Simulations
