Programming is an activity of designing Software Applications and Interactive Media.

A Software Application is a Control System with Digital Interfaces suited for the particular Domain.

Flows and User Interfaces around Data are the main Ingredients of Software.

Components constitute backend.
User Interfaces constitute the frontend.

Both require distinct mindsets.

Data
====
- ER / Binary / XML / Object
- Queries
- Serialization
- Storage and Caching
- Validation
- Indexing / Searching / Tagging
- Compression
- Ontology
- Analytics
- Events


Component Types
===============

Simple
- Loops
- Recursion
- System Calls and Instructions
- Arithmetic
- Functions / Co-Routines
- Jobs
- Processes

Compound
- Loaders / Locators for Libraries

Complex
- State Machines
- Push Down Automata
- Schedulers
- Controllers
- Routers
- Exceptions
- Debugging

Security
- Authentication
- Authorization

Data Flow
- Validation
- Logging
- Transforms
- Commands
- Queries
- Extractors
- Loaders

Flows
=====

Coupling in the form of

Non-Remote
- Function Calls
- Callbacks / Promises
- Table Based Dispatch / Ploymorphism
- Composition / Delegation
- Interceptors
- Commands
- Pub / Sub / Subject / Observers / Messaging / Eventing
- Promises

Remote
- RPC
- FBP
- Half Objects

Both
- Request / Response
- Tokens
- Message Queues

User Interfaces
===============
- Forms
- Widgets
- Layouts
- Scene Graph
- Roles and Actions

Programming
===========

0. Gather User Stories
1. Code the User Interfaces concretely or abstractly
2. Design Data
3. Couple User Interfaces to Components
4. Couple Components
5. Simulate / Demo
6. Repeat

Characteristics of Software
===========================
- Size
- Speed
- Bandwidth
- Memory

Deployment
==========
- Build
- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- Simulations / Tests

Naming Conventions
==================
Data / Events Should follow structural Naming Conventions.
Operations are AdjectiveNouns
Callbacks are VerbNouns

Files should be organized by
- Models (Re-Usable)
- Simple Components (Re-Usable)
- Complex Components
- Loaders / Locaters / Flow Code
- User Interfaces
