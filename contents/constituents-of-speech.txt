Most everyday speech is Politically driven.

Letters I believe, with complete prejudice, were given to us by musician-poets.

Alphabet agglutination in music notations is mapped to phrases and scenarios.
Meaningless letters act as placeholders, memorized and used in compression for story telling.
The popularity of the stories make their way into common tongue and into the brain makeup.

A meaningless letter is the ultimate parasite.

        We surround ourselves with stories, sounds, and gestures
        of endless variety.
        Create our own
        amusing ourselves to death.
        And yet forget.
        The endless stories of the dead
        who like us
        were addicted
        to the prosody of letters.
