Have experienced a bit of flow recently, here are my notes.

Closed Thinking
- anxious
- energetic
- ambitious
- failure averse
- distracted
- noisy
- obstacles

Creative Thinking
- humour
- ad lib
- curiosity
- multiple solutions
- no fear
- limits
- quiet
- play

It is easier to do trivial and little things than difficult things.
So I start with the difficult things.

I am also programming en masse than compile every syntax error.
It's interesting to depend on your thinking than the compiler.

Tips
* long/slow/forced breaths
* time limit of 1 1/2 hours
