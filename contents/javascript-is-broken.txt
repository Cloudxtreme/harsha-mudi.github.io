# this

broken

# typeof and instanceof

broken

a duck language that doesn't typeid ?
duck that

# prototype

no one in the world wants it.
class should be separate from the state.

# cps (callback passing)

cps is done by compilers.
how the fuck is that high level ?

# promises

promises can't solve producer consumer problem.
you need good old mutexes for that.

# constant library api breakage

thank god npm is not selling candy.

alice : why isn't this candy sweet ?
npm   : you know, salt is the new sweet.
alice : you are lame.

you can look at grunt and express for examples of this.

<h2>what the fuck is wrong with programming language communities ?</h2>

every language seems to have a "war" with

-------------------------------------------
goto                 | everyone
if                   | oops
pointers             | everyone
=                    | dysfunctional langs
while loops          | dysfunctional langs
return               | async
types                | ducked up langs
statements           | dysfunctional langs
sequential execution | dysfunctional langs
global variables     | everyone
-------------------------------------------

what else is there to program with ? butterflies ?

<h2>c++ has has all of them</h2>

every time I try these "war" languages, my appreciation for
c++ goes up.

every application that I ever liked using is in c++.

c++ offers abstractions to the programmer.
everyone else, forces.
