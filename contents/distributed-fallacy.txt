Taken from <a href="http://www.rgoarchitects.com/Files/fallacies.pdf">here</a>.

Essentially everyone, when they first build a distributed application,
makes the following eight assumptions.

All prove to be false in the long run and 
all cause big trouble and painful learning experiences.

The network is reliable
Latency is zero
Bandwidth is infinite
The network is secure
Topology doesn’t change
There is one administrator
Transport cost is zero
The network is homogeneous
        — Peter Deutsch
