<i>
TL;DR

I reject Abstractions as Art.
Art is Emotional.

AlgoArt like

(<a href="http://vimeo.com/4707422">Jedâ€™s Other Poem (Beautiful Ground)</a>)

which is handcoded by the Artist onto the Machine,
should be preferred over that which is automatically generated by Algorithms.
</i>

What is Art ?
=============

AlgoArt refers to using Algorithms to make what is presumed
to be Art.

Modern and Post Modern definitions of an Art Object treat
it as a thing-in-itself.

Such a definition is self-serving as the latter in particular
thrives on Kitsch.

An alternate definition is necessary to make the Artist a part
of the thing-in-itself.

Defining Art
============

I   Art is an Object that is artificially Produced by Artist[s] through a Medium.
II  The Object and the Artist[s] share an Emotion, a thing-in-itself.
III When consumed, thing-in-itself is experienced by mimesis.

Abstract Art is Art ?
=====================

Art is Emotional.
Emotion is a continuous Feeling.
Emotions are Finite.
Emotions are fluid.

Abstraction is an Understanding.
Abstractions are Infinite.
Abstractions are fixed.
Abstractions fail II.

For example, why is tying a shoe-lace not an Art ?
There are creative choices for the type of shoe, lace or holes.
Why isn't that taught in New York ?

The correct word for Abstract Artists is Artisans.

Fashion, Movie Making, Jewelry, Dancing, Photography, Paintings, anything
Post Modern fall into Abstract Art for the most part.

::Examples::

* Cubism vs Expressionist Painters
* Action Heroes vs Method actors
* Street Dancing vs Miming

Creativity
==========

Creativity is just a process. Not the End.
It is possible to be creative in Pointless activities.

Software is a bad case of flu virus
===================================

To be successful a software must,

* Spread Virally
* Be a Killer App
* Exert parasitical control over the Market

This is the predominant model for Software Development.
It is often justified as Worse is Better.

<b><i>We are disrupting Pen and Paper !</i></b>
What about my **doodles** ?

Software will often go for appeal over fidelity.

What Programmers are not
========================

* Engineers

  Reliability is rare in Software Products.

* Artisans

  Programmers practise Communal Politics.
  Longevity is greater for items than Objects.

* Artists

  The greatest tragedy ever faced by a Programmer is a coffee stain.

* Lawyers

  More like spell checkers that crash.

Just as Post Modernists elevate Kitsch to Art,
Programmers elevate sloppy practices to the Sublime and call it Hacking.

In practice a Hackers code is surrounded with comments like

// I don't know how this works
// Does this work ?
// How does this work ?
// Don't touch it, it works !
// TODO: Security
// TODO: This shouldn't be here

On second thought no other activity produces as much disgust
as reading source-code.

Yuck.

::Exceptions::

* Game Programmers

Software is Democracy ?
=======================

Practises like

* banning
* silencing
* spying
* revisionism

are built with Orwellian Efficiency into fundamental Software like

* IRC
* POSIX
* IMAP ( Email )
* Web Forums
* Wikipedia
* Git

The main reasons for implementing these "features" are cited as

* Spam
* Trolls

In practise this means that each Software Community lives
in a perpetual bubble, deaf to criticism.

Sometimes these "features" are profitable.

The hypocrisy reaches bizarre levels of absurdity as
Free Software Communities have Benevolent Dictators.

<b>These "features" make software a horrible Medium wrt I.</b>

Revisionism is particularly problematic as it can confound
authorship.

::Examples::

Linus Travesty
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/censorzilla.html">CensorZilla</a>
Big Data vs Encryption

::Exceptions::

Usenet

AlgoArt
=======

AlgoArt can be divided into

1. MachineArt

This is perfectly acceptable as Machines are tools in the
hands of Artists.

::Examples::

MS Paint
Demoscene

2. AutoArt

Art made automatically out of some mechanical Algorithms.

AutoArt fails I and II, hence it is rejected as Art.
There is no Machine Unlearning for A.I, yet.
To pass I, a program needs to cry when its brushes are taken away.

The problem is further confounded as most AutoArt is handcoded MachineArt.

On top of this, Worse is Better thinking means that AutoArt
has scary market potential.

::Examples::

Screensavers
<a href="http://algorave.com/">AlgoRave</a> -- Are Random Numbers sentient enough to make music ?

<b>__END__</b>

A photograph of a toothbrush could be made to mean
the monotonicity of Modern Life,
with enough deconstruction jargon.

Was there an Artist that felt it ?
