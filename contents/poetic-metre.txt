A poem has **meter** and **rhyme** like **rhythm** and **melody** in music.

> How do we identify **meter** ?

## First Some Definitions [1]

* syllable : enunciable unit of a word. Often represented in dictionaries with -'s.
             Example = ex-am-ple, id-e-a, wo-rd
* accent : style of enunciating.
* iamb : any two syllables, usually a single word but not always, whose accent is on the second syllable.
         Example = upon, arise
* trochee : any two syllables, usually a single word but not always, whose accent is on the first syllable.
            Example = virtue, further
* spondee : any two syllables, sometimes a single word but not always, with strong accent on the first and second syllable.
            Example = In "The long day wanes, the slow moon climbs", the words "day wanes" form a spondee.
* pyrrhic : any two syllables, often across words, with each syllable unstressed/unaccented.

            Example = intervene

           Example = tenderly

* iamb-ic, troch-aic, spond-aic,  pyrrh-aic, anapest-ic, dactyl-ic: when the line is made of iambs or trochee or ...

### If (iambic pentameter)

x = unstress
/ = stress
iamb = x /


x  /   x   /    x    /    x    /   x /
If you can keep your head when all a-bout you
x   /   x    /      x   /    x    /  x  /   
Are los-in-g theirs and blam-in-g it on you;
x  /   x   /     x    /    x    /   x   /
If you can trust your-self when all men doubt you,
x   /    x  /   x    /   x     /     x    /
But make al-low-ance for their doubt-in-g too:
x  /   x   /    x   /   x  /     x  /
If you can wait and not be tired by wait-in-g,
x   /  x    /    x /     x     /    x  /
Or, be-in-g lied a-bout, don't deal in lies,
x  /  x    /   x  /     x    /   x  /  
Or be-in-g hat-ed don't give way to hat-in-g,
x   /   x     /    x   /     x   /    x   /
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
...

-Rudyard Kipling[2]

The hypenation, as seen on

> x   /    x  /   x    /   x     /     x    /
> But make al-low-ance for their doubt-in-g too:

is useful to identify the meter.

Using a dictionary we can add hypenations that can help the reader analyse a poem.[5]
