I try to put things I understand into words, my *own* words.
I have come to realise, understanding is not learning.

After application, I have a much better understanding.
But I can't put it into words.

Then there is a question of creativity, which challenges my understanding
and forces me to unlearn.

And so I give up,
There is no *learning*.
Knowledge can never be complete.
I will never be contend.
I can only build on my past,
Focus on the problem now.

Create or Perish.
