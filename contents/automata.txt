Automata is about Memory + Computation.

Memory can be stores as a Single Variable.
This is called the Accumulator machine.

Memory can be stored as Stack.
This is called the Stack machine.

Memory can be stored in RAM or Registers.
This is called the RAM / Register machine.

Memory can be stored as Queue.
This is called the Queue machine.

Memory can be stored as Tape.
This is called the Turing machine.

Memory can be stored as a Token.
This is called the Token machine.

Memory can be stored as a Tree.
This is called the Tree machine.

State is a Data Structure tht should answer the following queries,
- What is the current state ?
- What are the next states ?
- Is the state at the beginning or is it at the end ?

In fact any Real World object from light to atom that can store this information is fit for use as Memory.

Computation is Reaction to Inputs.
Distributed Automata are best modelled by Queue Machines and Token Machines.
