"Anyone who wants to know the human psyche will learn next to nothing
from experimental psychology. He would be better advised to abandon exact
science, put away his scholar's gown, bid farewell to his study, and wander
with human heart throught the world. There in the horrors of prisons, lunatic
asylums and hospitals, in drab suburban pubs, in brothels and gambling-hells,
in the salons of the elegant, the Stock Exchanges, socialist meetings,
churches, revivalist gatherings and ecstatic sects, through love and hate,
through the experience of passion in every form in his own body, he would reap
richer stores of knowledge than text-books a foot thick could give him, and he
will know how to doctor the sick with a real knowledge of the human soul."

-- Carl Jung

There are multiple systems for personality types.

1. MBTI / Socionics
2. Enneagram
3. Four Temperments
4. Elemental

Is it possible to realize these types from the physiology of the brain ?

Consider the information pathways,

1. Thinker (Water, Rationals)
2. Sensor (Wind, Artisans)
3. Controller (Earth, Guardians)
4. Intuition (Fire, Idealists)

Total personalities = 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15.

5. Instinct

Introverted Thinking  - T ( Systems )
Extroverted Thinking - CST ( Facts )

Introverted Intuition - I ( Imagination )
Extroverted Intuition - CSI ( Multiverse )

Introverted Sensing - TI ( Taste )
Extroverted Sensing - CSTI ( Texture )

Introverted Feeling - NSIC ( Virtues )
Extroverted Feeling - NSTC ( Values )

Controller,

1. Makes Thinking more Objective (ET)
2. Filters Senses
3. Forces the Intuition to take reality into account.

Controller is essentially Mind over Body.
Instinct is Body over Mind.

   respectively.
