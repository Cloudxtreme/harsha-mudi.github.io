"Anyone who wants to know the human psyche will learn next to nothing from
experimental psychology. He would be better advised to abandon exact science,
put away his scholar's gown, bid farewell to his study, and wander with human
heart throught the world. There in the horrors of prisons, lunatic asylums and
hospitals, in drab suburban pubs, in brothels and gambling-hells, in the
salons of the elegant, the Stock Exchanges, socialist meetings, churches,
revivalist gatherings and ecstatic sects, through love and hate, through the
experience of passion in every form in his own body, he would reap richer
stores of knowledge than text-books a foot thick could give him, and he will
know how to doctor the sick with a real knowledge of the human soul."

-- Carl Jung
