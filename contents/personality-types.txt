"Anyone who wants to know the human psyche will learn next to nothing
from experimental psychology. He would be better advised to abandon exact
science, put away his scholar's gown, bid farewell to his study, and wander
with human heart throught the world. There in the horrors of prisons, lunatic
asylums and hospitals, in drab suburban pubs, in brothels and gambling-hells,
in the salons of the elegant, the Stock Exchanges, socialist meetings,
churches, revivalist gatherings and ecstatic sects, through love and hate,
through the experience of passion in every form in his own body, he would reap
richer stores of knowledge than text-books a foot thick could give him, and he
will know how to doctor the sick with a real knowledge of the human soul."

-- Carl Jung

There are multiple systems for personality types.

1. MBTI / Socionics
2. Enneagram
3. Four Temperments
4. Elemental

Is it possible to realize these types from the physiology of the brain ?

Consider the information pathways,

1. Thinker (Earth, Melancholic, Rationals)
2. Sensor (Water, Phlegmatic, Artisans)
3. Controller (Wind, Choleric, Guardians)
4. Intuition ( Fire, Sanguine, Idealists)

Total personalities = 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15.

5. Instinct ( Ether)

Introverted Thinking  - T ( Systems )
Extroverted Thinking - CT ( Facts )
Introverted Sensing - CS ( Taste )
Extroverted Sensing - S ( Texture )
Extroverted Intuition - CI ( Multiverse )
Introverted Intuition - I ( Imagination )
Extroverted Feeling - CN ( Values )
Introverted Feeling - N ( Virtues )

Extroversion, Introversion is mapped to Controller
Feeling, Judging is mapped to Instinct
Perceptiveness is mapped to sensing.

Active Controller makes,
1. Multiplies Sense Feedback
2. Makes Thinking more Objective (ET)
3. Filters Senses
4. Forces the Intuition / Imagination to take reality into account.

Controller is essentially Mind over Body.

Controller is made active,
1. To explore the senses
2. To deal with the world
3. When values are challenged

Misc
====
1. Best way to converse with people N, S C, I T followed by the others depending on the setting.

2. An unbalanced personality has weaknesses in one or more of the items.
   With age, meeting different personality types, work partners this gets
   blanced out in the end.

3. This aspects that are least developed are usually called Inner Child / Shadow / Id
   respectively.

4. Reprression pushes things into intuition.

5. Best way to work CT, CN, T, CI, C
   In other words forget virtues, stick to facts, mould all possibilities to the single vision and taste victory.

6.  Best way to evaluate S, I, CS, N
    In other words see the texture, test its virtues, is it refined, does it tirgger the imagination ?
