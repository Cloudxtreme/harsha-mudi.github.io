As long as you retain this notice, you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE VOID. CONSEQUENTIALLY, I AM NOT LIABLE
FOR ANY DAMAGES. Heck, even I can't get this to run sometimes.  If we meet IRL,
and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a Red Bull since you don't
want me drinking.
