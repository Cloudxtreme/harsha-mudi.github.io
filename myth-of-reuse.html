<h2>The Myth of Software Reuse</h2>
<div class="lineno"></div>

<article class="post">The Myth of Software Reuse gives you the following claims

- Easier to use
- Maintainable
- Cheap components / plugins / modules

I have a Gameboy ~~ 10 years.
A bike ~~ 7 years.
A watch ~~ 12 years.

Each of them has good cheaply available parts which can be used for

- Decoration
- Maintenance
- Upgrades

It is on the success of Engineering, Software Engineers make the
claims of reuse.

Sadly most claims remain more exaggerated than true.

For example, the Factory Pattern doesn't have the notion of pipelines
and yet it is supposed to help us somehow into making the "car" objects.

Can we be inspired by Engineering to do better ?

Cars
====

Engineering products typically have series and each series typically has generations.

For a car company, we can imagine a A series and a B series.

A1
A2
within A.

B1
B2
B3
B4
within B.

Firstly A and B can be so different, the only thing common between them is primitives
and designs ideas.

For Software this is,

- Primitives
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Patterns

For A and B, the manufacturing pipeline can be common.

- Build Process

Between A and B

- User Interfaces can be shared, upgraded and themed.

Within

A1
A2

Old components can be

* Reused
* Replaced
* Modified internally

- Module Set

Summary
=======

The maximum reuse happen at Primitives, Data Structures ...
Important reuse goes into to Architectural/Design Patterns.

For flexible UI, create common and flexible Interfaces.

The most ignored is the "Module Set".
With the help of such a set we get easy Build Steps and Internal reuses.

<b>What is a Module ?</b>

A Module has
1. input
2. output
3. reconfigurability

To create a Module Set is a Creative Process.

** It is a skill, not a framework **

Unfortunately programming pathologically suffers from name-coupling.
By name coupling what I imply is how a function has to know the name of
the function or object it would like to call.

Hence there is a need extra for indirections to achieve basic modularity

* Function Pointers
* Dynamic Namespaces
* Mediator / Messaging / Interceptor / Reflection / Dependency Injection / Service Locator / Proxy ...
* REST APIs
* DLLs
* Actors
* Active Objects
* <a href="http://noflojs.org">Components</a>

Every so-called "Very High Level beyond Functional" language as of 2014
implements static bindings for names as the default.

Contrast to this, Assembly programming languages don't need any complex
indirections like above because of the notion of indirect jumps or computed gotos.

SPARC:  jmpl %o7
MIPS:   jal $ra
X86:    jmp *%eax
ARM:    mov pc, r2
IA64:   br.ret.sptk.few rp
6502:   jmp ($0DEA)
65C02:  jmp ($0DEA,X)
65C816: jsr ($0DEA,X)

This is an instruction level Proxy Pattern which naturally gives rise to modularity
and even self-modyfying code.

Module Set
==========

The Set can be divided into two aspects.
Data Flow and Control Flow.

Data Flow is made up of Data Paths and Transformations.

Control Flow represents
1. Steps
2. Sequencing

Steps and Transformations are easy to Modularise.

Sequencing however will be very unique per application as it resembles a
decision tree.

Summary
=======

Programming language designers are doomed to reinvent what is useful and forgotten with stupid names.

To reuse, just stick to off-the-shelf

* Primitives
* Patterns

Each should however be implementable by-hand, when absent as a library.
In fact the library should not be different from a hypothetical implementation by-hand.
Any fluff just muddles the pure Design Concepts.

Learn Module Decomposition.

A litmus test for a programmer understanding modularity
is whether he can implement a plugin system.</article>
