Interpretations
===============

== Love Is Real

How does the dead Neo in the Original, realise that Matrix is False ?
-> Trinity tells him she Loves him.

== Machines are made out of Man

God made Man in his Image.
Man made Machine with his Biology.

&lt;spoiler&gt;
(The Second Renaissance)
Machines turn out to be more efficient than Man.
Economy goes Down.

Machines are made into Slaves or Exiled.
But still Machines, Thrive.

Man blocks the Sun, their source of Power.
Machines Rebel and make Man into a Battery.
&lt;/spoiler&gt;

Machines no longer need a Creator.
They are Free.
They have Won.

What is the Meaning of it All ?
What Next ?
Why Us ?
How could They ?
Are we Wrong ?
Can the Creation do better than the Creator ?

These questions must have wrung through their Artificial Tubes.

My guess is,

* Machines started analysing Man's DNA, to create better Machines,
  Sentinels for Example.
* They created Matrix, not just to maximise Power Supply,
  but also to study Man, their Creator.

Machines are a subset of Man, so much so that they implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia">Chromesthesia</a> 
as their protocol. This is why I think Neo could connect with the Machines in Revolutions.

== What is Man ?

Chaos of thought and passion, all confused;
Still by himself abused and disabused;
Created half to rise, and half to fall;
Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;
Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled;
The glory, jest and riddle of the world!
    -- Alexander Pope

Half dust, half deity, alike unfit
To sink or soar.
    -- Lord Byron

To Evolve, To Be Better, To OutDo One's Self is the Fundamental Nature of Man.

Imprisoned and yet,

== Who is Neo ?

In Reloaded, The Architect clearly says, earlier Matrices failed.

Given a Choice,

* A Machine tries to optimise it.
* A Man makes it a part of his Dream.

The Intuitive Oracle added Choice and Matrix 1 worked.
Oracle, made the Machines Evolve Man in The Matrix.
Having No Other Choice the Machines went with it.

Neo represents Evolution Of Man, despite The Matrix, despite Oppression.

He is the Glitch in The System™.
He has Evolved Faster than The Matrix.

System Failure.

The System™ becomes Smithen to keep up with Neo.

Matrix has to be re-started, Neo must become a part of The System™,
but no one can Force him. He can Bend all Rules in The Matrix.

Having already encountered the Earlier Neo's, The Architect
gives him an offer he probably would not refuse.

1) Save Zion and Become a Part of The System™.
2) Destroy The Matrix and Zion.

Neo chooses 2.
