<h2>Pretentious Lisp</h2>
<div class="lineno"></div>

<article class="post">1. Parens

John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky don't think of parens as a superior notation.
It's surprising how every Lisp implementer seems to neglect that.

Optional infix, postfix notation can easily be slapped on top of Lisp without losing
it's list like nature.

Alternative brackets were suggested by both of them.

How is (progn ... ) different from { } ?

Parens are, if any, an inferior notation.
f(g(h)) is the only place where it is acceptable.

2. Parenthetical Indentation

<pre>
 // In C
 for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     if (i % 2 == 0) {
         doSomething (i); }
     else {
         doSomethingElse (i); } }
</pre>

Can you identify the problems with the above C code ?

Hint: You can't add new statements without fucking up "{" and "}"

It's absolutely retarded.
How this became the mainstream Lisp style is beyond me.

Of course I am supposed to use autoident/paredit in emacs no less.
Firstly coupling a programming language with an editor is stupid.
Secondly there is no guarantee that autoindent and paredit work everytime.

Which begs the point, why is this shit enforced if it is useless ?
Allman style works in XML.

3. Lisp Code is pure poetry

Except it's not.

Hint: If you read a code snippet and you can't understand it.
      Assume that the author is sloppy.

Clarity is the sign of intelligence.
Terseness is a sign of obfuscation.

Now carefully look at `doSomething (i); }`.

Can you comment at the end without fucking "}" up ?

There you have it. Lisp code is poetry because adding a comment
means re-indenting the code.

4. Recursion is so high level you can't breathe

The dirty secret is, Lisp doesn't have control flow operators like

* break
* continue
* goto
* and even return in clojure

Yes return !

How do you disguise weakness ?
Obfuscate it as a Philosophy obviously !

Now you have the Moral highground without doing anything.
This is precisely what Haskell/ML/Scheme/Lisp camp does.

Recursion is merely one of the many varieties of Iteration.
You can write a quick-sort without recursion.
Just use a Stack to keep track.

Can the same be said of Recursion ?

5. Continuations

Assembly programmers called it co-routines.
They had the stack and context registers to mess with.

Continuations are merely the side-effect of hiding the machine from the programmer.

6. Macros

Possibly the most glorified language feature ever.

Is it also so high level you can't breathe ?

Assembly programmers called it "self-modifying-code".

10110000 01100001

^ That's machine code.

It's both an instruction and a number ("Homoiconicity").
With bit operators you can modify it, just like any other number.
Except by modifying it you can create a new instruction.

Was that so difficult to explain ?</article>
